# Abstracts

The `abstracts/` folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be put in here.

The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

>Note â€” The ***abstracts***/ folder might also be called ***utilities***/ or ***helpers***/, depending on what you prefer.
